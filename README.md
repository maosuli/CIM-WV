# Overview of CIM-WV

This paper presents a City Information Model (CIM)-generated Window View (CIM-WV) dataset comprising 2,000 annotated images collected in the high-rise, high-density urban areas of Hong Kong. 

1) Window view images of CIM-WV depict diversified urban scenes of Hong Kong at different locations, elevations, and orientations

2) The CIM-WV includes seven semantic labels, i.e., building, sky, vegetation, road, waterbody, vehicle, and terrain.


In addition, we provide variants of DeepLab V3+ models trained on CIM-WV, real window view images, Google Earth CIM-generated window view images from New York, and Google Earth CIM-generated window view images from Singapore, respectively.

# Contribution

1) CIM-WV is the first public CIM-generated photorealistic window view dataset with rich semantics. 
2) Comparative analysis shows a more accurate window view assessment using deep learning from CIM-WV than deep transfer learning from ground-level views.
3) For urban researchers and practitioners, our publicly accessible deep learning models trained on CIM-WV enable novel multi-source window view-based urban applications including precise real estate valuation, improvement of built environment, and window view-related urban analytics.
